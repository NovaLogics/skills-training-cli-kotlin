You have a program that counts pizza slices until thereâ€™s a whole pizza with 8 slices. 
Refactor this program in two ways:

Use a while loop.

Use a do-while loop.

----------------------

fun main() {
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    // Start refactoring here
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
    pizzaSlices++
    // End refactoring here
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}

*/

fun main() {
    useWhile()

    println()

    useDoWhile()
}

fun useWhile(){
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    // Start refactoring here

    while(pizzaSlices < 7){
        pizzaSlices++
        println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")

    }
    pizzaSlices++
    // End refactoring here
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}



fun useDoWhile(){
    var pizzaSlices = 0
    // Start refactoring here
    pizzaSlices++
    do{
        println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
        pizzaSlices++
    }while(pizzaSlices < 8)

    // End refactoring here
    println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
}
