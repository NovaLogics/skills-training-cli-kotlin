/* Classes in Kotlin

- Kotlin supports object oriented programming using classes and objects.
- Classes define a blueprint for creating objects, which can store data and behavior.
- Objects are created based on the structure defined in the class.

Declaring a Class
    - Use the class keyword to define a class.
        Example:
        class Customer


Why Use Classes?
    - Efficiency: Avoid repeating code for objects with similar characteristics.
    - Modularity: Group related data and functions together.
    - Reusability: Define the behavior and properties once, and reuse them across multiple objects.
